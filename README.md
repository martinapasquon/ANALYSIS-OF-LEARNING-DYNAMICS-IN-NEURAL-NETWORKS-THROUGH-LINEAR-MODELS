# ANALYSIS-OF-LEARNING-DYNAMICS-IN-NEURAL-NETWORKS-THROUGH-LINEAR-MODELS
This notebook aims to analyze the training dynamics of neural networks through the study of linear models. These models provide an analytical framework and allow for the examination of network behavior in a simplified yet theoretically tractable regime.
